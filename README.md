# Foundation, Drupal 7 Installation Profile and Theme
This installation profile and theme are designed to help designers and site builders get a head start on configuring a Drupal 7 site. The included Foundation theme uses Omega 3 as the base.

This installation profile also has a companion [tutorial series](http://friendlymachine.net/learning-drupal) to help those new to Drupal quickly learn the ropes.

See a [live demo](http://foundation.friendlymachine.net) of the installation profile. Although this project is not actively supported, I would appreciate any bug reports.
